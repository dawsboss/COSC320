# COSC320
#### Spring 2020 Joe Anderson
This course will cover in depth algorithm complexity analysis, algorithm design
techniques (greedy, divide and conquer, dynamic programming), and efficient algorithms for various problems
will be introduced. Advanced data structures such as hash tables, binary search trees, and red-black trees
will be studied. The complexity classes P and NP will also be covered.
